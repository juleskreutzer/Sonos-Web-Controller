To use Sonos Web Controller you first need to install [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org).
Download the installer from the link above and install it on your computer.

With the installation of NodeJS, NPM will also be installed.

Download the files needed for Sonos Web Controller by clicking the "Download ZIP" button to the left of this readme and place the files in a folder that is easy accessible from your terminal/command prompt.

The above steps shouldn't be to difficult to achieve. When you're done with the above steps you can proceed to the next steps.

 - Open your Terminal/Command Prompt
 - navigate to the map where you saved the files[1]
 - type ```node server.js``` and press the return button

[1] You could do this with the following command: ```cd path/to/your/files```

If you receive no errors in the output of the terminal/command prompt window, the application is running. You could test this by navigating to ```http://localhost:5005``` or click [here](http://localhost:5005).

##### Starting the Application

You have to follow the installation steps only once. When the application is installed, you can start it with the following commands:

 - ``` cd path/to/your/files``` 
 - ``` node server.js```

###### Keep your terminal/command prompt windows open in the background, otherwise the application will stop working
